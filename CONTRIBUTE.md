### How do we expect contributions to look like?

Contributions should be based on an issue with a separate branch. 
When the code should be merged into master a Pull Request referencing the issue in the comment should be created. 
All issues should aim to labelled accordingly and have a milestone associated where necessary.

## Pull Request Process

1. Please label the Pull Request with either **release:major**, **release:minor**, or **release:patch** that this
   Pull Request would represent. It will then adjust to the versioning scheme accordingly.
   The versioning scheme we use is [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).
   If you do however not think there is a need for a new release, please do label the Pull Request with "**norelease**".

2. All Pull Requests should aim to be reviewed by at least 1 other developer. The reviewer should then merge the Pull Request.
