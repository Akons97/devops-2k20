## Exclusions
The Service Level Commitment will not include unavailability to the extent due to:

## Definitions

* *Covered services* means the listed services for the relevant Cloud Product set forth here:
* *Monthly Uptime Percentage* means 100% minus the percentage of Downtime
  minutes out of the total minutes in the relevant calendar month.

  to that Covered Service. For cases in which we confirm a Covered Service was

  that minute is 100 %. If you attempted no requests to a Covered Service over a
  minute, the Error Rate is 0%.
* *Mean Response Time* is the mean time between every received request and it's
  response issuing.

  working(Downtime) and the point when it's fully operational again.
