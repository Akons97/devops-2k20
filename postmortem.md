# Security Review Postmortem
This document will outline a [Postmortem
documentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmortem_documentation "wikipedia
explaination") of our monitoring and pen-testing of the `U buntu?` service,
developed by *Group C*, as well as our security review of our own service.

## Review of Group C
We started by creating a monitoring tool collecting data about the `U buntu?`
service, and then started pen-testing their service. After approximately a week
of gathering monitoring data we had enough information to confidently evaluate
whether Group C were violating their Service-Level agreement. The following
order is therefore not a reflection of the order in which the tasks were
done, but merely with the intent of readability.

### Creating a monitoring tool
To investigate whether or not Group C lives up to their service-level agreement, we created a python script to monitor the uptime, response-time, and recovery-time of their webpage. The python script creates a csv file where metrics are continuously appended to the file. This is facilitated by the requests library that helps us send get requests to their webpage. If we receive a 200 status code, we log that the webpage is running as intended as well as a timestamp and the elapsed time since the request was sent. To make sure that this script is running 24/7, we moved the script to our droplet running our minitwit and run the script with a nohup command.

### Evaluating the monitored data
From the metrics in the csv file, we can calculate the requirements dictated by Group Câ€™s SLA. This calculation is done in a separate python script and outputs the following results:

Uptime: 100%

Response Time: 1.87 seconds

Time to Recover: 0 seconds

We see that the uptime of the webpage and therefore also the recovery time, is flawless and therefore lives up to the SLA. The response time, however, is considerably slower than the 200ms specified by the SLA. We gave the webpage the benefit of doubt and assumed that our monitoring implementation was somehow incorrect, but cross-validation with 3rd-party tools such as dotcom-tools.com confirmed that this was the case.

## Security review of own service
**First draft**

### Define Assets 

**Our assets are:**

Source Code:
If source code contains any secrets such as passwords and the like.
Information how the system is built and so forth.

Access to the Database:
If access is gained to the database it is possible to administer the database,
giving you full access to the database users and all data contained within the
database.

Access to audit data: 
The audit data shows all auditable events that occurred within the application.

(Do not know if vulnerabilities and threats are required)

**Vulnerabilities:**

- Open ports


**Threats:**

- Denial of service
- ClickJacking

## Penetration Testing of our own system

Our approach is to do both a penetration test, and a security audit. 

Tools: 
- Kali Linux
- Nmap 
- SqlMap
- Metasploit
- OWASP ZAP

**Procedure**:

In the security audit, we tried to follow OWASP guidelines for developing a secure application [Application Security Verification Standard](https://owasp-aasvs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
One of the points is to [Verify that secrets, API keys, and passwords are not included in the source code, or online source code repositories](https://owasp-aasvs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/requirement-2.29.html)
We realized that we are storing the admin password to the database in our docker-compose file. 
It is not optimal unless you can change the password in our system which you cannot.
That is a huge security flaw and must be solved.

The solution to this would be to change the password and make the password an environmental constant instead.

Next is the penetration test in which we have divided into several steps.


- **Step 1**
The first step is to make a port scan of the system. We use Nmap to get an overview of Enable OS detection and version detection
and open ports.
```
nmap -v -A 46.101.119.181
```

The most worrying finding is the open port at 1433 because it is our database. Also, in continuation of our admin database password being available in source code makes it quite straightforward to access our database. 
 
 - **Step 2**

Firstly, we will try to test if we are vulnerable to Injection flaws, such as SQL injection. 
SQL injection is the highest security risk according to OWASP
and in that case, it makes sense to try that on our system.
We used SqlMap to figure out if any of our inputs are injectable. If not, then SqlMap will return - 
*[WARNING] heuristic (basic) test shows that POST parameter 'username' might not be injectable*
That is, our system is not vulnerable regarding SQL injection. All tested parameters do not appear to be injectable.
 
 - **Step 3** 
Information about the DB.

Because the Database port is open it is possible to acquire information about the database
We will use a tool from Metasploit that will enumerate MSSQL configuration setting.

In essence, the module will perform a series of configuration audits and security checks against our Microsoft SQL Server database.

The password is required for the module to work and because the password is accessible in our source code it is not 
difficult to acquire.

Using auxiliary/admin/mssql/mssql_sql will allow for simple SQL statements to be executed against an MSSQL instance given appropriate credentials.
That is, if someone knows our password then they had all they did need to delete our database. Also, because we have
stated it would be catastrophic in our risk matrix if something happens to our database.

- **Step 4**

We have also tried to use another tool called OWASP ZAP.

It is an open-source web application security scanner and its main goal is to find vulnerabilities in web applications.
It will run different attack scenarios against the web application and record the results.

The results that we got from OWASP ZAP were:
```
X-Frame-Options Header Not Set

Risk: Medium

X-Frame-Options header is not included in the HTTP response to protect against 'ClickJacking' attacks.
```
and

```
X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing

Risk: Low

The Anti-MIME-Sniffing header X-Content-Type-Options was not set to 'nosniff'. This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome to perform MIME-sniffing on the response body, 
potentially causing the response body to be interpreted

```

A comment on the first result is that it can be solved by setting the X-Frame-Options HTTP header and ensuring it is set
 on all web pages returned by our web application.

A comment on the second result  is that it can be solved by ensuring that the web application sets the Content-Type header appropriately and that it sets the X-Content-Type-Options
Ensure that the application/web server sets the Content-Type header appropriately and that it sets the X-Content-Type-Options header to 'nosniff' for all web pages.

Overall, OWASP ZAP did not find any **critical** vulnerabilities and both vulnerabilities that OWASP ZAP reported can
be solved with few lines of code in our application. It is all about setting headers correctly concerning security.
