# Security Review Postmortem
This document will outline a [Postmortem
documentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmortem_documentation "wikipedia
explaination") of our monitoring and pen-testing of the `U buntu?` service,
developed by *Group C*, as well as our security review of our own service.

## Review of Group C
We started by creating a monitoring tool collecting data about the `U buntu?`
service, and then started pen-testing their service. After approximately a week
of gathering monitoring data we had enough information to confidently evaluate
whether Group C were violating their Service-Level agreement. The following
order is therefore not a reflection of the order in which the tasks were
done, but merely with the intent of readability.
